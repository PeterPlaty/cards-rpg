# CARDS RPG
This game is about cards, using a CTB battle system. The controls are meant to be flashy and responsive, with intuitive status effects and attack numbers.

Possible actions:
- Left Click: Attack
- Right Click: Defend
- Scroll Wheel Up: Skill
- Scroll Wheel Down: Item

Instead of using SP, players use cards. Defending halves the damage and can get a card from the protected entity (a random one if it is an enemy).
The card deck used is the standard one (52 cards), and each number has its own properties. Properties do not differ between seeds.

Card suites:
- Hearts: Healing
- Spades: Attack
- Clover: Elemental Magic
- Diamonds: Buffs Magic

Card numbers:
- Ace: doubles the effect of the skill used when the card was drawn
- King: shows the next card in the deck
- Queen: draws the next card in the deck
- Jack: inflicts a status ailment with next attack (life regen, bleed, card drain, blind)
